## 🎯 Three Use Cases

### **1. Market Research**
**Task**: "Analyze EV market growth, calculate CAGR, identify top manufacturers"
- Researcher finds market data
- Coder calculates growth rates
- Manager synthesizes comprehensive report

### **2. Financial Analysis**
**Task**: "Calculate ROI, payback period, and NPV for this investment"
- Researcher gathers financial context
- Coder performs calculations
- Manager creates financial recommendation

### **3. Technical Comparison**
**Task**: "Compare AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for AI/ML workloads"
- Researcher collects features and pricing
- Coder analyzes cost-performance
- Manager creates comparison matrix

## 🎤 Sample Presentation Flow

### **Opening**
"I want to show you something exciting—a multi-agent AI system that works like a virtual consulting team."

### **The Demo**
"Let me give you a task that needs both research and calculations..."
*(Run solar panel ROI example)*

### **The Magic**
"Watch the activity log—you can see each agent's contribution. The Researcher gathering facts, the Coder doing math, the Manager pulling it all together."

### **The Aha Moment**
"Notice how we got a comprehensive analysis in under 2 minutes that would normally take a person 30-60 minutes of research and calculation."

### **The Close**
"This is the future of AI: specialized agents collaborating, fully transparent, handling complex real-world business problems."

## 🎯 Objection Handling

**"Can't ChatGPT do this?"**
→ "Single AI agents lack specialization. Our multi-agent approach delivers higher quality through focused expertise."

**"How accurate is it?"**
→ "The Coder agent uses actual code execution for calculations, ensuring mathematical accuracy. Research is sourced from the AI's training data."

**"Is it secure?"**
→ "Built on Azure OpenAI—enterprise-grade security, your data never leaves your tenant, full compliance."

**"How much does it cost?"**
→ "Based on Azure OpenAI API usage. Typical task costs $0.10-0.50, far less than human analyst time."

**"Can we customize it?"**
→ "Absolutely. Add more agents, integrate with your data sources, customize the workflow for your use cases."
